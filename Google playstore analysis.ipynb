    "#there various part of NLP 1st is \"tokenization\" where we do is we split the text or sentence into words and phrases 2nd is \"parsing\" where i'm analyzing the grammer structure \n",
    "# analyzing what grammer is being used whether its past tense present tense participle and then comes the part of \"speech tagging\" that is POS tagging means what role that \n",
    "#each word plays in a sentence \n",
    "#another objective: is to generate the language by understanding the labnguage i'm trying to generate in natural language which is appropiate and meaningfull language like\n",
