# Google-Playstore-Reviews-Analysis
 Google Playstore Analysis & Sentiment Dashboard

This repository contains a detailed end-to-end data analysis project on the Google Play Store app data along with an interactive web-based dashboard.
The project covers everything from Data Cleaning, EDA, Sentiment Analysis, and Data Visualization using Python libraries like Plotly, Pandas, NLTK, and Sklearn.

**Project Objective**

The main objective of this project is to:
	‚Ä¢	Clean and preprocess the Google Playstore Dataset
	‚Ä¢	Handle missing values, duplicates & irrelevant data
	‚Ä¢	Transform and normalize the data
	‚Ä¢	Analyze sentiment of user reviews using NLP (Sentiment Analysis)
	‚Ä¢	Generate interactive visualizations using Plotly
	‚Ä¢	Build a Web-Based Interactive Dashboard for presenting key insights

**Technologies Used**
	‚Ä¢	Python
	‚Ä¢	Jupyter Notebook
	‚Ä¢	Pandas & NumPy
	‚Ä¢	NLTK (VADER Sentiment Analysis)
	‚Ä¢	Scikit-learn
	‚Ä¢	Plotly Express
	‚Ä¢	HTML & CSS (for dashboard)
	‚Ä¢	Webbrowser (Python library)
 
**Key Components**

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
	‚Ä¢	Missing Value Handling: Used .dropna() and .fillna() methods.
	‚Ä¢	Duplicate Handling: Used .duplicated() and .drop_duplicates().
	‚Ä¢	Outlier Removal: Filtered ratings > 5.
	‚Ä¢	Type Conversion: Converted data types for columns like Reviews, Installs, Price, Size.
	‚Ä¢	Data Normalization: Converted app sizes into MB and applied log transformation on Installs and Reviews.

2. Sentiment Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Performed Sentiment Analysis on user reviews using VADER Sentiment Analyzer.
	‚Ä¢	Derived a Sentiment Score for every review.
	‚Ä¢	Categorized sentiments as Positive, Negative, Neutral.

3. Feature Engineering
	‚Ä¢	Added new metrics like:
	‚Ä¢	Revenue = Price √ó Installs
	‚Ä¢	Rating Group (Top Rated, Above Average, Average, Below Average)
	‚Ä¢	Extracted Year from the Last Updated column.

4. Data Visualization & Dashboard
	‚Ä¢	Created Interactive Graphs using Plotly Express:
	‚Ä¢	Top Categories
	‚Ä¢	Free vs Paid App Distribution
	‚Ä¢	Rating Distribution
	‚Ä¢	Sentiment Score Distribution
	‚Ä¢	Installs by Category
	‚Ä¢	Updates Over Years
	‚Ä¢	Revenue by Category
	‚Ä¢	Most Common Genres
	‚Ä¢	Last Update Impact on Ratings
	‚Ä¢	Ratings Comparison (Paid vs Free)
	‚Ä¢	All graphs were saved as HTML Files.
	‚Ä¢	A Web-based Dashboard was designed using HTML & CSS with interactive plots and one-line insights.

**Key Insights**
	‚Ä¢	Free apps dominate the Play Store.
	‚Ä¢	Categories like Tools, Entertainment, and Productivity are the most common.
	‚Ä¢	Positive Sentiments are dominant but mixed reviews exist.
	‚Ä¢	Paid apps generally have higher ratings than free apps.
	‚Ä¢	App updates have been increasing over the years.
	‚Ä¢	Genres like Action & Casual games are highly preferred.

**Tasks**These FIVE Tasks has been given by the client(NULL CLASS) to complete 

1. Visualize the sentiment distribution (positive, neutral, negative) of user reviews using a stacked bar chart, segmented by rating groups (e.g., 1-2 stars, 3-4 stars, 4-5 stars). Include only apps with more than 1,000 reviews and group by the top 5 categories.

2. Create a dual-axis chart comparing the average installs and revenue for free vs. paid apps within the top 3 app categories. Apply filters to exclude apps with fewer than 10,000 installs and revenue below $10,000 and android version should be more than 4.0 as well as size should be more than 15M and content rating should be Everyone and app name should not have more than 30 characters including space and special character .this graph should work only between 1 PM IST to 2 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.

3. Create an interactive Choropleth map using Plotly to visualize global installs by Category. Apply filters to show data for only the top 5 app categories and highlight category where the number of installs exceeds 1 million. The app category should not start with the characters ‚ÄúA,‚Äù ‚ÄúC,‚Äù ‚ÄúG,‚Äù or ‚ÄúS.‚Äù This graph should work only between 6 PM IST and 8 PM IST; apart from that time, we should not show it in the dashboard itself.

4. Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of ratings for each app category, but only include categories with more than 50 apps and app name should contain letter ‚ÄúC‚Äù and exclude apps with fewer than 10 reviews and rating should be less 4.0. this graph should work only between 4 PM IST to 6 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.

5. Plot a time series line chart to show the trend of total installs over time, segmented by app category. Highlight periods of significant growth by shading the areas under the curve where the increase in installs exceeds 20% month-over-month and app name should not starts with x, y ,z and app category should start with letter " E " or " C " or " B " and reviews should be more than 500 as well as this graph should work only between 6 PM IST to 9 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.
