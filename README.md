	â€¢	Pandas & NumPy
	â€¢	NLTK (VADER Sentiment Analysis)
	â€¢	Scikit-learn
	â€¢	Plotly Express
	â€¢	HTML & CSS (for dashboard)

**Key Components**

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
	â€¢	Missing Value Handling: Used .dropna() and .fillna() methods.
	â€¢	Duplicate Handling: Used .duplicated() and .drop_duplicates().
	â€¢	Outlier Removal: Filtered ratings > 5.
	â€¢	Type Conversion: Converted data types for columns like Reviews, Installs, Price, Size.
	â€¢	Data Normalization: Converted app sizes into MB and applied log transformation on Installs and Reviews.

2. Sentiment Analysis
	â€¢	Performed Sentiment Analysis on user reviews using VADER Sentiment Analyzer.
	â€¢	Derived a Sentiment Score for every review.
	â€¢	Categorized sentiments as Positive, Negative, Neutral.

3. Feature Engineering
	â€¢	Added new metrics like:
	â€¢	Revenue = Price Ã— Installs
	â€¢	Rating Group (Top Rated, Above Average, Average, Below Average)
	â€¢	Extracted Year from the Last Updated column.

4. Data Visualization & Dashboard
	â€¢	Created Interactive Graphs using Plotly Express:
	â€¢	Top Categories
	â€¢	Free vs Paid App Distribution
	â€¢	Rating Distribution
	â€¢	Sentiment Score Distribution
	â€¢	Installs by Category
	â€¢	Updates Over Years
	â€¢	Revenue by Category
	â€¢	Most Common Genres
	â€¢	Last Update Impact on Ratings
	â€¢	Ratings Comparison (Paid vs Free)
	â€¢	All graphs were saved as HTML Files.
	â€¢	A Web-based Dashboard was designed using HTML & CSS with interactive plots and one-line insights.

**Key Insights**
	â€¢	Free apps dominate the Play Store.
	â€¢	Categories like Tools, Entertainment, and Productivity are the most common.
	â€¢	Positive Sentiments are dominant but mixed reviews exist.
	â€¢	Paid apps generally have higher ratings than free apps.
	â€¢	App updates have been increasing over the years.
	â€¢	Genres like Action & Casual games are highly preferred.
